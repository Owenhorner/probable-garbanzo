# Playwright Test Project for The-Internet

## Project Context
- Testing framework: Playwright
- Target website: https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/
- Node.js version 23 environment with TypeScript
- DevContainer enabled project

## Best Practices for File Organization
- Group related tests in feature-specific directories
- Separate page objects from test files
- Keep utilities and helpers in dedicated directories
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Store test data separately from test logic
- Keep environment configurations isolated

### Additional
- Comment all code you generate
- Prefer simplest solution
- Suggest README.md updates where applicable, in regards to changing development environment setup

### Prompts
- In an effort to stay transparent, keep a copy of the prompt or log of the inputs in conversations
- Prompts will be saved in prompts/features/ , prompts/refactoring , prompts/testing directories
- Only successful prompts will be kept
